## Development Status
Zine is still a young project, not yet at feature parity with more popular
alternatives (e.g. Hugo), but it's perfectly able to handle a personal website
with a blog.

## Getting Started
Go to https://zine-ssg.io to get started.

## GitHub Actions
If you plan to build your website with GitHub Actions, take a look at [kristoff-it/setup-zine](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-zine), the official
GitHub Action to get access to Zine in your runner.

We also have more complete guides at https://zine-ssg.io/docs/.
